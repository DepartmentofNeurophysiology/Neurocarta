This code can be used to replicate (most of the) figures in the accompanying article. The code depends on Neurocarta functions so make sure to run the `startup` command in the root folder. Start by downloading and importing the AMBCA by running `build_database`, then move into this folder and run `generate_maps` to construct the networks, calculate DOS matrices, etc. When done each article figure can be recreated by running its corresponding function file.
